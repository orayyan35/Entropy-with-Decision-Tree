# Entropy-with-Decision-Tree
 Entropy, Average, and Gain Calculation
This repository contains Python code for computing entropy, average, and gain. These calculations are commonly used in decision tree algorithms and information theory.

Entropy
Entropy is a measure of uncertainty or disorder in a set of data. In the context of decision trees, entropy is used to quantify the impurity of a dataset.

Average
Average is a measure of the central tendency of a set of values. In this repository, we calculate the average entropy across different categories.

Gain
Gain is a metric used in decision tree algorithms to determine the most informative features for splitting the data. It is calculated by comparing the entropy before and after a split.
